The Wellness Wizard project aims to develop a comprehensive health monitoring system that
integrates multiple sensors to measure vital health parameters such as blood pressure, body
temperature, heart rate, SpO2
, and ECG. The device is designed for home use, enabling
individuals to track their health in real-time without requiring frequent hospital visits.
To ensure a high degree of accuracy and reliability, the system uses specialized sensors
connected to a microcontroller, which collects real-time data and processes it. This data is then
analyzed using smart analysis to predict potential health risks or identify early signs of disease. A
key feature of the Wellness Wizard is its emergency SOS function, which can instantly alert
nearby hospitals or contacts during a medical emergency, ensuring that users can access
immediate help when needed.
The device's hardware is compact and portable, making it user-friendly for daily use. The project
focuses on combining smart healthcare analytics with affordable and accessible hardware, thus
contributing to preventive healthcare solutions. Additionally, the device's data analysis feature
provides users with real-time feedback on their health status, empowering them to take proactive
steps in managing their health.
